## üéØ Value Proposition

### **TECHNICAL TRANSLATOR & STRATEGIC BRIDGE-BUILDER**
As one of the rare user researchers with deep technical expertise in AI engineering and data science, I excel at translating complex user needs into actionable technical requirements. This unique combination enables me to facilitate seamless collaboration between design, research, and engineering teams while ensuring user-centered solutions remain technically feasible and scalable.

### **COMPLEXITY SPECIALIST WITH PROVEN IMPACT**
I tackle the technology industry's most challenging problem spaces‚Äîfrom Counter-Abuse and Child Safety to Age-Assurance, Regulatory Readiness, Conversational AI, and Cloud Computing. With a decade of experience navigating these high-stakes environments, I consistently deliver research insights that drive both user satisfaction and business outcomes in domains where precision and ethical considerations are paramount.

### **MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH AUTHORITY**
My PhD in Anthropology establishes me as a leading expert in qualitative research methodology, while my ongoing Master's at UC Berkeley School of Information strengthens my quantitative capabilities through advanced statistical analysis and applied machine learning. This dual expertise allows me to uncover deep user insights through ethnographic methods and validate findings through rigorous data analysis, providing comprehensive evidence for strategic decision-making.
