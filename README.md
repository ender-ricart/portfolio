### **TECHNICAL TRANSLATOR & STRATEGIC BRIDGE-BUILDER**
I am an experienced UX researcher with deep technical knowledge in applied machine learning and statistical analysis. This unique combination means I can translate and communicate across professional divides, delivering on user needs that are technically feasible and scalable.

### **COMPLEXITY SPECIALIST WITH PROVEN IMPACT**
I do not shy away from tackling the most challenging problem spaces. I have worked in Agentic AI, Conversational Design, Counter Abuse, Child Safety and Age Assurance, Regulatory Readiness, and Cloud Computing. With a decade of experience navigating these nebulous environments, I consistently deliver research insights that drive both user satisfaction and business outcomes in domains where precision and ethical considerations are paramount.

### **MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH AUTHORITY**
My PhD in Anthropology establishes me as a leading expert in qualitative research methodology, while my ongoing Master's at UC Berkeley School of Information strengthens my quantitative capabilities through advanced statistical analysis and applied machine learning. This dual expertise allows me to uncover deep user insights through ethnographic methods and validate findings through rigorous data analysis, providing comprehensive evidence for strategic decision-making.

## Experience

### **Google — Staff UX Researcher**
**2020 - present (5 years)**

* Led a cross-functional NLP program to streamline end-user abuse reporting, reducing processing times by mapping user-centered abuse taxonomies to internal labels and implementing LLM for abuse detection.
* Led a large-scale international study on minors' encounters with online abuses and jointly published with Harvard University professor - Help-seeking and Coping Strategies for Technology-facilitated Abuse Experienced by Youth
* Foundational research in Google Cloud resulted in the launch of 6 new products: Batch computing, Flexible Use Discounts, Shared Reservations, Spot VMs, Task Queues, Dynamic Workload Scheduler, and a re-architecting of Machine Families structuring.

### **LivePerson, Artificial Intelligence Research Team— Principal UX Researcher**
**2019 - 2020 (1 year)**

* Published series of Medium articles related to conversational design: Link 1, Link 2
* My xFN collaboration resulted in development of patent for new ML training algorithm based on UXR insights into conversational structuring across turn-exchanges (patent: 11,522,818 · Issued Dec 6, 2022).

### **Amazon, Seattle — Sr. UX Researcher**
**2017 - 2019**

Produced research insights that were used and adopted across Alexa and even more broadly in Amazon and are purportedly still used today. Examples include:
1) the first research into customer privacy and security concerns related to the use of conversational AI as "creepy", and;
2) the creation of Alexa customer archetypes based on engagement behavior, emotional registers, and cognitive associations that were pairable with user account identifiers for targeted Alexa content.
